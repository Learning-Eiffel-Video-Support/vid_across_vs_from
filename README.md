# Learning Eiffel - Across vs From Loops
This is roughly the code (with imrpovements) that was used in the making of the Learning Eiffel video found at: https://youtu.be/4i1bfw4QtHI

The intent of this code is to demonstrate the reason you would choose to use an across loop over a from loop. It also demonstrates through example how to itegrate or combine the across loop with the from loop.
